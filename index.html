                    My name is James Lovejoy and I am an aspiring web developer. I am learning html, CSS, and Bootstrap.
                    What I love to do is solve problems.  To quote the great Vanilla Ice 
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rog8ou-ZepE" target="_blank">"If there's a problem yo, i'll solve it"</a>.
                    Debugging code and implementing new concepts into an already existing design are the things that have really drawn me into the wide world of web development so far.      
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have a pretty diverse background beginning with a mechanical engineering degree, backed up with forensic engineering exerpience, time spent as a field staff for a wilderness therapy company in the deserts of Oregon (if you don't belive me that Oregon has deserts, i'd love to tell you about them!), and a short stint at a brewing company while I learned to code.  There's a lot of science and problem solving in the making of beer too!  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whether its working in a team or on my own I am your guy.  I have the due deligience and work ethic to stay motivated and on schedule by myself. However, the communication skills I have developed and honed with my diverse background give me the ability to adapt to any team setting and fill in the gaps.
